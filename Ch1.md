1. What new concept in computing was introduced in the design of Babbage's Analytical Engine?
   
   > Babbage's Analytical Engine introduced the concept of programming to computing. In Babbage's design, the operation of the Analytical Engine was controlled by a pattern of holes punched on a card that the machine could read.

2. Who is generally regarded as the first programmer?
   
   > Augusta Ada Byron

3. What conecpt lies at the heart of von Neumann architecture?
   
   > The heart of von Neumann architecture is the stored-programming concept, in which both data and programming instructions are stored in the same memory system.

4. What is the difference between hardware and software?
   
   > Hardware is tagible and comprises the physical parts of a computer; software is intangible and consists of the programs the computer executes.

5. Traditional science is concerned with abstract theories or the nature of the universe not human-made artifacts. What abstract concept forms the core of computer science?
   
   > The abstract concept that froms the core of computer science is problem-solving.

6. What are the three criteria an algorithm must satisfy?
   
   > - Clearly and unambiguously defined
   > 
   > - Effective, in the sense that its steps are executable
   > 
   > - Finite, in the sense that it terminates after a bounded number of steps

7. What is the distinction between algorithmic design and coding? Which of these activities is usually harder?
   
   > Algorithmuc design refers to the process of designing a solution strategy to fit a particular problem; coding refers to the generally simpler task fo representing that solution strategy in a programming language.

8. What is meant by the term higher-level language? What higher-level language is used as the basis of this text?
   
   > A higher-level language is a programming language that is designed to be independent of the particular characteristics that differentiate computers and to work instead with general algorithmic concepts that can be implemented on any computer system. The higher-level language used in this text is called Java.

9. How does an interpreter differ from a compiler?
   
   > Each type of computer has its own machine language, which is different from the used in other computers. The compiler acts as a translator from the higher-level language into the machine language used for a specific machine.

10. What is the relationship between a source file and an object file? As a programmer, which of these files do you work with directly?
    
    > A source file contains the actual text of a program and is designed to be edited by people. An object file is created by the compiler and contains a machine-language representation of the program. Most programmers never work directly with object files.

11. What is the difference between a syntax error and a bug?
    
    > A syntax error is a violation of the grammatical rules of the programming language. The compiler catches syntax errors when it translates your program. Bugs are errors of the logic of the program. Programs containing bugs are perfectly legal in the sense that the compiler can find no violation of the rules, but nonetheless they do not behave as the programmer intended.

12. True or false: Good programmers never introduce bugs into their programs.
    
    > False. Even the best programmers make mistakes. One of the marks of a good programmer is the ability to find and correct those mistakes.

13. True or false: The major expense of writing a program comes from the development of that program; once the program is put into practice, programming costs are negligible.
    
    > False. Between 80 and 90 percent of the cost of a program comes from maintaining that program after it is put into practice.

14. What is meant by the term software maintenance?
    
    > The term software maintenance refers to development work on a program that continues after the program has been written and released. Although part of software maintenance involves fixing bugs that were not detected during initial testing, most maintenance consists of adapting a program to meet new requirements.

15. Why is it important to apply good software engineering principles when you write your programs?
    
    > Programs are usually modified many time over thier lifetimes. Programs that use good software engineering principles are much easier for other programmers to understand and are therefore easier to maintain.

16. What is the fundamental difference between the object-oriented and procedural paradigms?
    
    > Under the traditional procedural paradigm, programs consist of a collection of procedures and functions that operate on data; the more modern object-oriented paradigm treats programs as a collection of objects, for which the data and the associated operations are encapsulated into integrated units.

17. What steps are involved in running an applet under the control of a web browser? In what ways does running a Java applet differe from running a Java application?
    
    > Running an applet in a web browser consists of the following steps:
    > 
    > - The user enters the URL for the applet page into a web browser.
    > 
    > - The browser reads and interprets the HTML source for the web page.
    > 
    > - The appearance of an applet tag in the HTML source file causes the browser to download the compiled applet over the network.
    > 
    > - A verifier program in the browser checks the applet intermediate code to ensure that it does not violate the security of the user's system.
    > 
    > - The Java interpreter in the browser program runs the compiled applet, which generates the desired display on the user's console.
    > 
    > Executing a program as a Java application runs the interpreter directly without the intercession of the browser.
